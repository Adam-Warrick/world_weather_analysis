Final Weather_Challenge docs are found in the weather_Challenge folder. 

## Analysis
The goal of this project is to create an app of sorts that identifies cities using lat and long coordinates. With that data, we can identify the temp, wind condition, humidity, current weather conditions etc. We also added a way to track how long it would take to go by bike, car, and walking to get to each destination city. The user can pick what temps they would like for vacation and find cities matching those temps accordingly.
